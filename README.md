# Employee Registration App Challenge: Build Your CRUD Skills with React!
### You are tasked to build a real-world application using React and test your understanding of CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) in a front-end context. Think of it like a to-do list, but for employees!

## Task:
### Develop a React application for employee registration. This app will allow user to manage employee data, including:
### Adding new employees: Users can create new employee profiles by providing details like name, email, phone number, image, position, and a unique ID. (Create)
### Searching for employees: Users can search for existing employees by their ID for quick retrieval. (Read)
### Editing employee information: Users can modify existing employee details to keep data up-to-date. (Edit)
### Deleting employees: Users can remove employee profiles from the system when necessary. (Delete)

## Data Persistence
### Arrays: You can initially store employee data in JavaScript arrays for simplicity.
### Local Storage: For a more persistent solution, explore using the browser's Local Storage API to save and retrieve employee data across sessions.

## Tips:
### Break down the functionalities into smaller tasks (search, add, edit, delete).
### Make use of React components to structure your UI and manage state.
